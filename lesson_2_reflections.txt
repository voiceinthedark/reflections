-What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

After running git init, the directory I am working in becomes a repository.
The files are untracked but part of the repository.
We need to init a git in order to make the present working directory
 a repository.

-How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
 repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area works like a cache at an intermediate stage between the git
repository and the working directory.
These files in the staging area are files that are waiting to be committed
yet has not been.
The value the staging area give us is that offer us an option to reset and
cancel any commit we need to make before adding the files and commit it
to the repository.

-How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

By adding files to the staging area, you have a chance to review your files
as part of a same logical unit to be commit to the repository, or whether
there need to be some changes done before the commit.
