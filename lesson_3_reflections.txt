-When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Plenty of situations require remote repository in addition to a local one. For example a collaborative project requires 
a central repository so that a group can work on the same project together.
Another benefit of remote repository is the fact that it's a cloud copy of your local work; hence even if collaborative
work is not required, having a backup place that stores the same project is a safeguard in case your project got deleted; 
hard drive got corrupted or stolen...
