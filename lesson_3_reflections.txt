-When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Plenty of situations require remote repository in addition to a local one. For example a collaborative project requires 
a central repository so that a group can work on the same project together.
Another benefit of remote repository is the fact that it's a cloud copy of your local work; hence even if collaborative
work is not required, having a backup place that stores the same project is a safeguard in case your project got deleted; 
hard drive got corrupted or stolen...

-Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

if a user is satified with the current version locally and working on different branches trying to experiment or adding new features. In this case it is not valid to sync automatically with the remote; rather wait and do pulls when the current work is done locally, especially in a collaborative environment.
